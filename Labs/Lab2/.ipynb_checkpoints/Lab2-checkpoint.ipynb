    "Thus far what we've done in python has been very simple, short tasks. To be useful, though, programs often need to be much longer. Moreover, such programs often involve tasks that must be done repetitively, or there are tasks that we want to perform that are common to many programs. We've already encountered an example of the latter: the sin function. There are many, many reasons why one might want to take the sin of something, so it is useful to define the sin function once and for all so that any program that needs to take the sin can do so, rather than having to come up with their own approximation of the sin using the Taylor expansion or something like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capability that we are seeking is provided by defining new functions. This allows us to make our own functions that are just like the sin function, and can be called in a similar way. Functions are defined by the following syntax:"

    "This defines a very simple function. Let's walk through this declaration step by step:\n",
    "The first line begins with def, then the name of the function, and then in parentheses a list of arguments for the function, then a colon. Arguments are inputs to the function. For example, the sin function takes an angle as an argument. In this example our function has two arguments. The number of arguments is arbitrary, and can be zero, in which case the parentheses are just left empty. It is also possible to write functions where the number of arguments is variable, and need not be the same every time the function is called, but we won't discuss that capability further in this short course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After the define line, we begin the body of the function. Note that all the lines in the function body are indented. This indentation is IMPORTANT. In python, indentation is used to indicate that a particular line belongs to a particular function, loop, or other block of code. All the lines of the function are indented four spaces. If you're using entering this manually in ipython, either at the command line or in the notebook, you don't need to type in those four spaces by hand; the ipython shell will automatically enter them for you after seeing the def line. If you're using emacs as a text editor, you can just hit the tab key and the correct number of spaces will be entered for you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the body of the function, we can enter whatever commands we like. We can print things, for example. The arguments in that appeared in parentheses in the definition are accessible within the function, and can be manipulated however we like.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the function, we have a statement that begins return. A return function causes the function to give back a value, which the calling program can print, assign to a variable, or do something else with. For example the sin function returns the sin of the input angle. Return values are optional: functions don't have to return anything, and can just end.\n",

Keep your eye out for these as we proceed as I'll be asking you to include docstrings with all of the functions that you write this semester. \n",

    "We just entered a function at the command line. This is helpful in that it lets us use the function any time we want without having to type in every single command more than once. When you define a function within a notebook, you can use it throughout that notebook without having to redefine it.

In particular, whenever you write a complex line of code (something that it would be hard for you to come back tomorrow, look at and know instantly what it does), you should write a comment above it explaining what it does.

First, we import the numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries so that we can use arrays, make plots, etc. Note that we have to import these libraries within the module EVEN IF they have already been imported in our main ipython session. Definitions and import statements are specific to the module where they are called, and functions that are defined or imported into the main session (or the main program, if we're running non-interactively) do not affect other modules, and vice-versa: something that is imported into a given module will not also be imported into the main session.\n",

We begin a line with if and then we follow that with a test that will be either true or false. In this case, we compare the input function name to 'sin' and see if it matches. The comparison is done with the == operator -- more on that in a moment. If the input funcname matches 'sin', we go ahead and plot a sin function. The line to do this is indented another 4 spaces, to indicate that this command belongs within the block to which the if applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name doesn't match 'sin', we next compare it to 'cos'. The statement that does this is 'elif', which is short for 'else if'. The meaning of 'elif' is that we first check the if statement. If it is true, we execute the block of code within that if statement. If it is false, we then go on to the 'elif' line and do that test. If that test turns out to be true, we execute that block of code. In this case, if the input value of funcname is 'cos', then we will plot a cos function. If the elif turns out to be false, we go on to the next one, that compares the input to 'tan'. If that is true, we plot tan. If not, we encounter an 'else'. The 'else' statement is the catchall: it's what we do if all the if's and elif's turn out to be false. In this case, we just print out a message complaining that we don't recognize the input function.\n",

We start with a list of objects -- in this example a list of strings, but it could be anything -- and then we say for variable in list:, followed by a block of code. The code inside the block will be executed once for every item in the list, and when it is executed the variable will be set equal to the appropriate list item. In this example, the list names had four objects in it, each a string. Thus the print statement inside the loop was executed four times. The first time it was executed, the variable n was set equal to alice. The second time n was set equal to bob, then charlie, then dana.\n",

The try statement is followed by the block of code that might generate the error. In this case, we're going to try to loop over wavelength. We won't actually do anything -- we just want to see if it's possible to perform the loop. Thepass statement is a statement that does nothing. It's just a placeholder, inserted because there has to be something inside the for loop. Finally, we get to the line except TypeError:. This line ends the try block, and its purpose is to specify what we do if we get an error. The syntax is that we say except, and then we list one or more types of errors we want to handle. In this case, we want to handle TypeErrors, which arise (among other things) when we try to iterate over something that is not iterable. The final line specified what we do if we generate an error of this sort. The answer is that we turn wavelength into a list of one element, so that we can iterate over it.
